/**
 The HomeView will display several different types of EventViews
 the different cards will represent a list of actions that were performed.
 Actions are going to be started, stopped, and tracked in an AddView.
 The Home view will display in a long list all the actions that have previously
 occurred in chronological order. As the different types of events occur in the AddView are updated to the App - the HomeView will udpate alongside it.
 At the end of the day - the user should perform a journal entry to write about
 how their day went, reflect on progress or just express themselves.
