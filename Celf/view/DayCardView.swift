/**
 
 The Day Event will display to the user an end of day report of the
 acitivties the performed to manage their stress in the form of badges.
 The badges are like the badges of accomplihsments in the Kindle App.
 Where each action that you perform such as meditation, journaling, talking to
 friend etc, are displayed to the user. There is a rating system for the day
 in the form of five stars. I want the stars to always show - and for the none filled
 stars to be empty. The DayEventView will exist inside of a list view in the
 HomeView.
